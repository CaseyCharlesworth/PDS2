Submission for assignment 2 - Practical Data Science

## Please note ##
I was not aware of the python template on Blackboard until after I had fully completed my assignment. Therefore I have not used it. HOWEVER, my data files are exactly split into the headings you defined, and clarified below (and also with clear commenting in the .py scripts themselves). The extension is also embedded in the other code (via a loop) and therefore not split into a separate file.

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN FILES

In order to run the files, please ensure all python files are located in the same directory, along with the two datasets downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality. [As it was not specifically mentioned in the spec to submit these files as part of the zip, they have been excluded from submission.]

Please run files in this order (the first one creates two new .csv files that are read into the latter two):

## Task 1: Data retrieving ##
PDS2_clean.py

## Task 2: Data exploration ##
PDS2_explore.py

## Task 3: Data modelling and Optional extension ##
PDS2_model.py
 

Thank you
Casey

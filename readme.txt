Submission for assignment 2 - Practical Data Science

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN FILES

In order to run the files, please ensure all python files are located in the same directory, along with the two datasets downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality. [As it was not specifically mentioned in the spec to submit these files as part of the zip, they have been excluded from submission.]

Please run files in this order (the first one creates two new .csv files that are read into the latter two):

PDS2_clean.py
PDS2_explore.py
PDS2_model.py
 

Thank you
Casey
